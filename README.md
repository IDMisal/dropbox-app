## Task
Development of a serverless file synchronization application using ReactJS and Firebase that allows users to authenticate, upload files, and manage folders. The application should feature modern file sharing and storage functionalities.

## Description
This Dropbox-like app aims to replicate key features of popular file hosting services like Dropbox. The main features include:

- **User Authentication**: User authentication with Firebase for secure login and signup.
- **File Uploads**:Users can upload files and organize them into folders.
- **File Sharing**: Generate links to share files with others.
- **Folder Management**: Create, delete, and navigate through folders.
- **Profile Customization**: Edit profiles.
- **Responsive Design**:User-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.

## Firebase Configuration  
To connect the application to Firebase, follow these steps:

    1. **Create a Firebase project** on [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    2. **Add a web app** to the Firebase project and obtain your Firebase configuration object.
    3. Replace the placeholder in your project with the actual Firebase configuration in `firebase.js`:

javascript
// firebase.js
import firebase from 'firebase/compat/app';
import 'firebase/compat/auth';
import 'firebase/compat/firestore';
import 'firebase/compat/storage';

const app = firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
});

const firestore = app.firestore();
const storage = app.storage();
const auth = app.auth();

export { firestore, auth, storage };

    4. Enable Authentication: Go to Firebase Console, navigate to Authentication, and enable Email/Password sign-in.
    5. Set Up Firestore Database: Create necessary collections for users, files, and folders.
    6. Set Up Storage: Use Firebase Storage to upload files.
